        <section id="Why Altschool">
            <h3>&#128153;Why Altschool:</h3>
            <p>As a technology professional with experience in the industry, I joined AltSchool’s School of Engineering Cloud Program to deepen my knowledge of cloud technologies and contribute to the cloud-native ecosystem while advocating for cloud adoption. AltSchool provides the structured learning process I need, making it easier to stay on track despite my busy schedule. The flexibility to revisit lessons and catch up on missed live classes ensures continuous learning. Additionally, the hands-on practicals reinforce my understanding, and the diploma certificate at the end is a valuable milestone worth looking forward to.</p>
